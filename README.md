## 💁🏽‍♂️ Overview

It's guess the words game

## ⚙️ How it works

Each level contains 7 words the user has
to guess. The app shows hints of the answers

The user has to tapp in buttons containing
portions of the answers to complete one of them

When the user guesses all the words, they move
to the next level
